1.	What is a block-level element? What are some examples of block-level elements? What are they used for? Block-level elements are any elements that starts on a new line. <dir> <p> <div> <h1> <li>. They´re used to set a group of content.
2.	Can you find any good charts or resources on when you should use these elements? For example, when might you use a div versus a section? <div> can be very useful when working together with CSS. You can create groups and set the configurations for those with the CSS saving time. <section> is good for the developer as a semantic resource to create sections inside the html doc and keep it organized.
